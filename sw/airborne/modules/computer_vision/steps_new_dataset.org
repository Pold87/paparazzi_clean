This is a short list that shows the step by step introduction to
record a new data set.

* Start video recording on Bebop (video_thread)
- Could have a look into Roland's video thread function

* Copy images from Bebop

* Read out CSV file from bebop 
  Use FileZilla and go to /.../.../volker_strobel/xx.csv

* Aggregate CSV file 
Since Optitrack sends many more estimates than images that we actually
take, we have to aggregate them using the function:

/home/pold/Documents/Internship/group.R

---
library(plyr)

X <- read.csv('/home/pold/from_bebop/00003.csv')

agg <- ddply(X, .(image), summarize,  xs=mean(x), ys=mean(y))

agg <- rename(agg, c("image"="id"))
matches <- rep(100, nrow(agg))
final <- cbind(agg, matches)
write.csv(final, 'final.csv', quote=F, row.names=F)
---

* Run get_histograms.c

* Copy files to bebop
  mat_train_hists_all.csv
  mat_train_hists_color.csv
  mat_train_hists_texton.csv
  final.csv

* Adapt settings
- Adapt number of histograms

* Mind which CSV file to use for textons
textons_malik.csv or textons.csv
